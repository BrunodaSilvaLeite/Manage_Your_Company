## 🚀 Technologies
This project was developed with:
- Typescript
- NodeJs
- React(Create-React-App)

## 🧑‍💻 Project
The "ManageYourCompany" 📈 project is a project that creates companies, units and assets. The rule is that every company has multiple units and the units have multiple assets.
This is a project with the intention of exercising my Backend skills with NodeJs and front with react.

Units have multiple assets, these assets are machines with multiple fields: name,image,description,model,owner,status,healthLevel.

And the main idea is to visualize the units and assets in general, or to visualize a single specific unit.
