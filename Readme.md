## 🚀 Technologies
This project was developed with:
- Typescript
- NodeJs
- React(Create-React-App)
- Express
- Mongoose
- Mongodb

## 🧑‍💻 Project
The "ManageYourCompany" 📈 project is a project that creates companies, units and assets. The rule is that every company has multiple units and the units have multiple assets.
This is a project with the intention of exercising my Backend skills with NodeJs and front with react.

Units have multiple assets, these assets are machines with multiple fields: name,image,description,model,owner,status,healthLevel.

And the main idea is to visualize the units and assets in general, or to visualize a single specific unit.

## 🚨 very important
It is very important to have the database turned on too (if it is locally) and connected with your mongodb too, it is very important to turn on the backend before the front.
